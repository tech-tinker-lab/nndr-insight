- **Spatial indexing** for geographic analysis
- **Population script** (`populate_master_gazetteer.py`) for data integration

### 3. Business Rate Forecasting System
- **Complete forecasting schema** (`forecasting_system_schema.sql`) with 8 core tables:
  - `forecasting_models` - Machine learning and statistical models
  - `forecasts` - Individual property forecasts
  - `non_rated_properties` - Properties identified as potentially rateable
  - `forecasting_scenarios` - Economic and policy scenarios
  - `forecasting_reports` - Generated reports and summaries
  - `property_valuation_history` - Historical valuation changes
  - `market_analysis` - Market trends and indicators
  - `compliance_enforcement` - Compliance monitoring and enforcement

### 4. System Design Documentation
- **Comprehensive system design** (`BUSINESS_RATE_FORECASTING_SYSTEM.md`)
- **Table analysis and implementation plan** (`TABLE_ANALYSIS_AND_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`)
- **Technical architecture** with data, analytics, and application layers
- **Implementation timeline** with 4 phases over 12 months

## Key Features
