- **Location Factors**: Area type, accessibility, economic indicators
- **Market Factors**: Local market trends, supply/demand
- **Economic Indicators**: GDP growth, inflation, employment rates
- **Policy Factors**: Rate changes, relief schemes, exemptions

### 4. Validation and Testing
- **Cross-Validation**: K-fold cross-validation for model robustness
- **Back-Testing**: Test models on historical data
- **Performance Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R-squared
- **Confidence Intervals**: Quantify forecast uncertainty

## Non-Rated Property Identification

### 1. Detection Methods

#### A. Geographic Analysis
- **Building Footprint Analysis**: Identify commercial buildings not in rating list

- **Business Directories**: Yellow Pages, Google Business, etc.
- **Social Media**: Business activity indicators

#### C. Property Characteristics
- **Building Type**: Commercial vs. residential classification
- **Size Thresholds**: Properties above certain size likely commercial
- **Location Context**: Commercial areas, industrial estates

### 2. Scoring Algorithm
- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Combine multiple indicators
- **Weighted Scoring**: Different weights for different factors
- **Confidence Levels**: Quantify certainty of rating potential
- **Priority Ranking**: Rank properties for investigation

### 3. Investigation Workflow
- **Automated Screening**: Initial automated assessment
- **Manual Review**: Human review of high-priority cases
- **Field Investigation**: Physical inspection where needed
- **Decision Tracking**: Record investigation outcomes
