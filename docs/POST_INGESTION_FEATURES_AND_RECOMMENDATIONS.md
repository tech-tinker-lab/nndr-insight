# Post-Ingestion Features & Recommendations

Now that OS and ONSPD data are ingested into staging tables, you can unlock a wide range of business features and analytics. This document summarizes actionable next steps and recommendations for both backend and frontend refinement.

---

## 1. Business Features You Can Build

### Geospatial Search & Lookup
- Find properties/addresses by postcode, UPRN, coordinates, or name
- Reverse geocoding: Given a lat/lon, return the nearest address or property
- Map visualization: Show properties, postcodes, or boundaries on a map

### Data Enrichment
- Join OS/ONSPD data with business rates, land registry, or other datasets
- Add geospatial context to business records (assign region, ward, or local authority)
- Calculate distances to key features (nearest road, river, school, etc.)

### Reporting & Analytics
- Coverage analysis: Properties per postcode, ward, or region
- Spatial distribution: Heatmaps of property density, business rates, etc.
- Change detection: Track new, removed, or changed addresses over time

### Data Quality & Cleansing
- Detect duplicates, missing geocodes, or mismatches between datasets
- Flag outliers (e.g., properties with invalid postcodes or coordinates)

### User-Facing Features
- Interactive map search (frontend)
- Downloadable reports (CSV, Excel, GeoJSON)
- APIs for address lookup, validation, or geocoding

## 2. Backend Recommendations

### Database
- Normalize and index staging data into production tables
- Add spatial indexes (PostGIS) for fast geospatial queries
- Use materialized views for common aggregations

### API Layer
- RESTful endpoints for property/address search, geospatial queries, and enrichment
- Validation endpoints (e.g., postcode validation)
- Batch endpoints for bulk lookups

### Data Pipeline
- Automate regular ingestion (cron, Airflow, etc.)
- Add data validation and logging at each step
- Automated tests for data integrity

---

## 3. Frontend Recommendations

### User Experience
- Map-based search and visualization (Leaflet, Mapbox, etc.)
- Responsive, fast autocomplete for address/postcode search
- Data download/export options
- Clear error messages and data quality indicators

### Analytics Dashboards
- Charts and maps for property distribution, coverage, or trends
- Filters for region, property type, etc.
- Drill-down from region to postcode to property

### Admin/Data Ops
- Upload new datasets via UI
- Monitor ingestion status and data quality
- Manual data correction tools

## 4. Next Steps & Prioritization

1. Define key business use cases (e.g., address search, property mapping, coverage analytics)
2. Design normalized production tables and ETL from staging
3. Build/extend backend API endpoints for these use cases
4. Add spatial queries and indexes in the database
5. Enhance frontend with map and search features
6. Iterate with user feedback to refine features and UX
