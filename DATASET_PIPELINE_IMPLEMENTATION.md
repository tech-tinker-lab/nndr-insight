# Dataset Pipeline System Implementation

## Overview

The Dataset Pipeline System is a comprehensive solution for managing data ingestion workflows from file upload to production-ready datasets. It provides a structured approach to data quality management with approval workflows and validation at each stage.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Dataset Management** - Register and configure datasets
2. **Pipeline Stages** - Define custom pipeline stages with validation rules
3. **File Upload** - Upload files to specific datasets
4. **Approval Workflow** - Manager approval for stage progression
5. **Validation Framework** - Automated and manual validation checks
6. **Audit Logging** - Complete audit trail of all actions

### Pipeline Stages

The system supports a flexible pipeline with the following standard stages:

1. **Upload** - Initial file upload and basic validation
2. **Staging** - Schema mapping and data type validation
3. **Filtered** - Business rule validation and data cleaning
4. **Final** - Production-ready data with final quality checks
5. **Custom** - Additional stages as needed
